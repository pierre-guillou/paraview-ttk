 * @class vtkInSituPipeline
 * @brief abstract base class for all in situ pipelines.
 * @ingroup Insitu
 *
 * vtkInSituPipeline is an abstract base-class for all in situ analysis
 * pipelines.
 *
 * A pipeline has three stages: Initialize, Execute and Finalize.
 *
 * `Initialize` is called exactly once before the first call to `Execute`. If
 * `Initialize` returns `false`, the initialization is deemed failed and
 * pipeline is skipped for rest of the execution i.e. either Execute nor
 * Finalize will be called.
 *
 * `Execute` is called on each cycle. If the method returns false, then the
 * execution is deemed failed and the `Execute` method will not be called in
 * subsequent cycles.
 *
 * If `Initialize` succeeded, then `Finalize` is called as the end of the
 * simulation execution. `Finalize` is called even if `Execute` returned
 * failure. However, it will not be called if `Initialize` returned failure too.

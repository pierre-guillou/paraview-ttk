/**
 * @class   vtkSMDomain
 * @brief   represents the possible values a property can have
 *
 *
 * vtkSMDomain is an abstract class that describes the "domain" of a
 * a widget. A domain is a collection of possible values a property
 * can have.
 *
 * Each domain can depend on one or more properties to compute it's
 * values. This are called "required" properties and can be set in
 * the XML configuration file.
 *
 * Every time a domain changes it must fire a vtkCommand::DomainModifiedEvent.
 * Applications may decide to update the UI every-time the domain changes. As a
 * result, domains ideally should only fire that event when their values change
 * for real not just potentially changed.

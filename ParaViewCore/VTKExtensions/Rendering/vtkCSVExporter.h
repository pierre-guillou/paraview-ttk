/**
 * @class   vtkCSVExporter
 * @brief   exporter used by certain views to export data as a CSV
 * file.
 *
 * This is used by vtkSMCSVExporterProxy to export the data shown in the
 * spreadsheet view or chart views as a CSV. The reason this class simply
 * doesn't use a vtkCSVWriter is that vtkCSVWriter is designed to write out a
 * single vtkTable as CSV. For exporting data from views, generating this single
 * vtkTable that can be exported is often time consuming or memory consuming or
 * both. Having a special exporter helps us with that. It provides two sets of
 * APIs:
 *
 * \li \c STREAM_ROWS: to use to stream a single large vtkTable as contiguous chunks where each
 * chuck
 * is a subset of the rows (ideal for use by vtkSpreadSheetView) viz. OpenFile,
 * WriteHeader, WriteData (which can be repeated as many times as needed), and CloseFile,
 * \li \c STREAM_COLUMNS: to use to add columns (idea for chart views) viz. OpenFile,
 * AddColumn (which can be repeated), and CloseFile.
 *
 * One has to pick which mode the exporter is operating in during the OpenFile()
 * call.

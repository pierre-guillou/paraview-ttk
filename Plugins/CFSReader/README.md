# CFSReader plugin

ParaView/VTK reader plugin for openCFS data files.

openCFS is an academic based FEM and structural optimization software under MIT/X11 license: opencfs.org

The data files are hdf5 based and called .cfs, .h5ref, .nmf and .nrf.
Theses are only different extensions for the same file structure.
Reasons for so many extensions: reference files for testing, forks, legacy

Dependencies: hdf5 (c-api and c-HL) via vtk

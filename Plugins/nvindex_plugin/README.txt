# Compatibility and Prerequisites
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NVIDIA IndeX for ParaView Plugin is compatible with:

* ParaView-5.5.0 and later.
  (depending on the downloaded package, Windows 64-bit).
* OpenMPI-1.7.4
  (if running in client-server mode).
* NVIDIA IndeX 2.0
  (installed with the ParaView plugin).
* NVIDIA GPU(s) supporting CUDA compute capability 3.0 or higher, i.e. Kepler
  GPU architecture generation or later.
* NVIDIA display driver version 387.26 or later on Linux and
  391.03 or later on Windows.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Features and Licensing
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NVIDIA IndeX for ParaView plugin comes with a free workstation license that
enables exploiting the capabilities of a single GPU.

If you aim to use NVIDIA IndeX on a cluster of multiple hosts and/or
with multiple NVIDIA GPUs, then please contact us for the appropriate licensing.

# Features
----------

* Real-time and interactive high-quality volume data visualization of both,
  regular and unstructured volume grids

* Interactive visualization of time varying regular volume grids.

* Supporting 8-bit and 16-bit unsigned int, and 32-bit floating point volume
  data types.

* Advanced rendering techniques with three different configurable presets for
  Iso-surfaces, Depth enhancement and Edge enhancement.

* Multiple, axis-aligned volume slice rendering combined with volumetric data.

* Catalyst support for regular grids to do in-situ based visualization.

* User defined region of interest selection.

* Advanced filtering and pre-integration techniques enabling high-fidelity
  visualizations.

* Depth-correct integration of ParaView geometry rendering into NVIDIA IndeX
  volume rendering.

* Free single GPU version for leveraging today's GPU performance.

* Multi-GPU and GPU cluster support for scalable real-time visualization of
  datasets of arbitrary sizes. Requires an appropriate license
  (please contact us).

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Known Limitations and Bugs in the BETA release
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Regular volume grids
-------------------------

* Datasets larger than a single GPU's available memory cannot be rendered.
  This issue is plugin specific and shall be resolved in the next release
  version.

* Datasets in *.vtk format wonâ€™t distribute to the PV Server and cause
  errors. Please use *.pvti or any other format instead for distributed data
  This issue is ParaView specific. Please contact Kitware for additional details.

# Unstructured volume grids
---------------------------

* Datasets containing degenerated faces may result in correct renderings
  or cause ParaView to fail. The NVIDIA IndeX ParaView plugin tries to resolve
  all invalid faces automatically.

# Auxiliary
-----------

* The Windows version of the NVIDIA IndeX plugin for ParaView is restricted
  to run on a single workstation/computer only, i.e., cluster rendering
  is not supported on Windows platforms.

* When loading an older state file with both volumetric and geometry data without
  NVIDIA IndeX representation saved in it, first frame shows only volumetric data and when you
  interact the subsequent frames are correct again with both geometry and volume data.

* When using further NVIDIA ARC software installations (such as the NVIDIA IndeX
  native library) in parallel, please avoid conflicts between library versions,
  e.g., by setting your environment LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately.

* There is also a known crash on exit on certain Ubuntu releases.

===========================================================================

                   The FreeType Project LICENSE
                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """  
    Portions of this software are copyright Å  <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc.

j. RTMP specification license
=============================

RTMP Specification license
Copyright (C) 2003-2009 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All rights reserved.
Published April 2009

This is a legal agreement (âAgreementâ) between the user of the Specification
(either an individual or an entity) (âYouâ), and Adobe Systems Incorporated (âAdobeâ)
(collectively the âPartiesâ). If You want a license from Adobe to implement the RTMP
Specification (as defined below), You must agree to these terms.
This is an offer to be accepted only on the terms set forth in this Agreement.
You accept these terms by accessing, downloading, using, or reviewing the RTMP Specification.
Once accepted, Adobe grants You the license below, provided that You fully comply with these terms.
If You do not agree to these terms, then You are not licensed under this Agreement.
If You attempt to alter or modify these terms, then the offer is no longer valid and is revoked.

The RTMP Specification provides a protocol for high-performance streaming transmissions of
audio, video, and data content between Adobe Flash Platform technologies.
We offer this license to encourage streaming rich content via the RTMP protocol.

The RTMP Specification may not be copied, photocopied, reproduced, translated, or converted
to any electronic or machine-readable form in whole or in part without written approval from Adobe.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon acceptance of the terms of this Agreement,
You may print out one copy of this manual for personal use provided that no part of this manual may be printed out,
reproduced, distributed, resold, or transmitted for any other purposes, including, without limitation,
commercial purposes, such as selling copies of this documentation or providing paid-for support services.

Definitions

âCompliant Implementationâ means the portion of an application, product, or service that defines
creates or processes data compliant with the requirements expressly stated in the RTMP Specification.

âEssential Claimâ means a claim of a patent that is necessarily infringed in order to achieve a Compliant Implementation.
A claim is necessarily infringed only when there is no technically reasonable way to avoid infringement
of that claim when following the requirements of the Specification to make a Compliant Implementation.

âRTMP Specificationâ means the specifications found at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/rtmp/.
Only the RTMP Specification published by Adobe will be considered the RTMP Specification for purposes of this Agreement.
Any specification not published by Adobe or one that incorporates the RTMP Specification in part,
in whole or by reference shall not be considered the RTMP Specification for purposes of this Agreement.

Patent License

Upon your acceptance of these terms, Adobe grants You a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, personal, worldwide license under Adobeâs Essential Claims to make, have made, use,
sell, offer to sell, import and distribute Compliant Implementations.

Prohibited Uses

The rights and licenses granted by Adobe in the RTMP Specification, including those granted in the Patent License,
are conditioned upon Your agreement to use the RTMP Specification for only streaming video, audio and/or
data content and not to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import or distribute:
(i) any technology that intercepts streaming video, audio and/or data content for storage in any device or medium; or
(ii) any technology that  circumvents technological measures for the protection of audio, video and/or data content,
including any of Adobeâs secure RTMP measures. No right or license to any Adobe intellectual property is granted
for such prohibited uses.

Defensive Suspension

If You assert, threaten to assert, or participate in the assertion of a lawsuit, proceeding, claim or similar action
directed either (i) against any other person or entity, including Adobe, claiming that a Compliant Implementation
infringes a patent, or (ii) against Adobe, claiming that any Adobe product infringes a patent,
then Adobe may at its discretion terminate all license grants and any other rights provided under this Agreement to You.

Reservation of Rights

All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

Trademarks

Adobe, ActionScript, and Flash are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe and may be registered in the

l. SQLite
=========

SQLite Is Public Domain

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for
example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other
open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the
SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code
has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

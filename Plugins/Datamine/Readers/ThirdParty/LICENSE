Subject: datamine reader


    Hi Jeremy,

    Sorry to interrupt, but I stumbled across some code you wrote in 1999 to read datamine format files and the copyright requires I contact you assuming I have the right person :-) To keep this short would you be willing to let us use your code under a BSD license so that we can include it with our free visualization software ParaView?  That would also allow us to update it to support new compilers etc without having to contact you.

    The software in question is

    https://github.com/ObjectivitySRC/PVGPlugins/blob/2221e86477e44db2be8a8511d526854b3909293c/NonBSDPlugins/DataMineReader/dmfile.h

    Thanks a bunch!
    Ken

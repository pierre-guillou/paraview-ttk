# BivariateRepresentations ParaView plugin

## Overview

This plugin brings to ParaView new representations to visualize bi-variate data.
- The `vtkBivariateNoiseRepresentation` allows to visualize bi-variate data with Perlin noise.
- The `vtkBivariateTextureRepresentation` allows to vizualize bi-variate data using a 2D color texture.

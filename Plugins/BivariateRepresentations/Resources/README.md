# BivariateRepresentations ressources

## Notice
Please note that we do not rely on the VTK CMake `vtk_encode_string` mechanism to encode
these textures at compile time. The reason is that we rely on `vtkTexture` proxys to open,
so by using file paths.

## Acknowledgement
The 2D color textures shipped with this plugin are based on the work of Steiger et al.

# This test runs through the steps described in the python trace tutorial
# to appear in a Kitware Source newsletter.
#
#  Trace is enabled and the following actions are captured and then replayed:
#
#  A sphere source is created then a PythonAnnotation filter is created.
#Â  Its expression contains a '\n'.
